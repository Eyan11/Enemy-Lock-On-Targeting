About This Project:

This is a small demo I made in Unreal Engine using C++ with the goal of improving my Unreal Engine and C++ skills. The focus of the demo is on the enemy lock on targeting camera system which is inspired by the 3D Zelda games. 



How it Works:

When the targeting input is held, the camera spring arm automatically adjusts its position and length to keep the player and the nearest target in focus, while also allowing the player to control how the camera spring arm rotates. Players can switch to the nearest target by quickly releasing and then holding the targeting input, and if the nearest target is the same as last time, it will target the second nearest target if there is one in range. An additional feature added that is not present in the Zelda games is the ability to switch to the left or right target with a single input. Other important systems developed to support or showcase the targeting system include the player controller, targeting arrow UI, player melee combat system, and enemy controller/AI.​​

​

Why This Feature is Important in Games:

An enemy targeting system is used in games to make combat for controller players much easier, since the player can hold the targeting input (usually left trigger) to aim instead of using the right stick constantly, which frees up their right thumb for actions like attacking with the buttons on the right of the controller. Without this feature, players would generally have 2 options. One, players would have to constantly move their right thumb between the right stick to adjust their aim, and the right buttons to attack, dodge, use abilities, or some other action. Or two, players could use a claw grip which can be uncomfortable and hard for beginners. ​​

This feature isn't just used for combat, but in many other games. One other example is in Rocket League, where the player can toggle on and off "ball cam", which is essentially the same system except it targets a soccer ball instead of an enemy. This allows the player to keep the ball in view without the car having to face the ball or the player having to rotate the camera to face the ball constantly.
