About This Project:

This is a small demo I made in Unreal Engine using C++ with the goal of improving my Unreal Engine and C++ skills. The focus of the demo is on the enemy lock on targeting camera system which is inspired by the 3D Zelda games. 

When the targeting input is held, the camera spring arm automatically adjusts its position and length to keep the player and the nearest target in focus, while also allowing the player to control how the camera spring arm rotates. Players can switch to the nearest target by quickly releasing and then holding the targeting input, and if the nearest target is the same as last time, it will target the second nearest target if there is one in range. An additional feature added that is not present in the Zelda games is the ability to switch to the left or right target with a single input. Other important systems developed to support or showcase the targeting system include the player controller, targeting arrow UI, player melee combat system, and enemy controller/AI.
